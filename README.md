# Two player chess game
Two-player chess game played in the terminal. Project carried out with the aim of creating a moderately complex project in C++, refamiliarizing oneself with the concepts of object-oriented programming and smart pointers.

## Introduction

This is a simple 2-player game implemented in C++ that runs in the terminal. The game is designed for two players to play against each other on the same computer. It's a text-based game that provides a fun and interactive experience for players.

## Gameplay
The white player first gives the position of the piece he wishes to move, then the computer gives him his possible moves for that piece. The player can then move the piece by entering the position he wishes to move to. Now it's black's turn, and he plays in the same way as white. The game continues until checkmate or stalemate. An example of a game is shown below:

## Future

I did this project to refamiliarize myself with the C++ language, which I hadn't worked with for a long time, so I didn't feel the need to implement a graphical interface. I may implement one in the near future, so I wrote the code in such a way that it wouldn't be complicated to add.
